=begin

 an array of integers representing asteroids in a row, for each
asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents
its direction (positive = right, negative = left). Return the state of the
asteroids after all collisions (assuming they are moving at the same speed).
If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. When they are the same
size, they both explode. Asteroids moving in the same direction will never
meet.

Example:

$ asteroids([5, 8, -5])
$ [5, 8] // The 8 and -5 collide, 8 wins. The 5 and 8 never collide.

$ asteroids([10, -10])
$ [] // The 10 and -10 collide and they both explode.
